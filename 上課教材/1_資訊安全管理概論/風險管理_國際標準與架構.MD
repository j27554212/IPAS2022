### [NIST RMF(Risk Management Framework)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_Management_Framework)
- [NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r2.pdf)
  - This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. 
  - The RMF provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; 
    - control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring. 
  - The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. 
  - The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; 
    - provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; 
    - and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life cycle. 
  - Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. 
  - In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization’s information systems and inherited by those systems.

### CNS/ISO 27005(2018)
- [ISO 27005]()  [[ISO/IEC 27005白皮书]](http://www.gxaqhbzx.com/news/shownews.php?id=37)
  - 目前有四份國際標準(ISO27001、ISO20000、BS25999及BS10012)的核心要求均需要建立與執行風險管理機制
  - 然而對企業而言還是不夠，例如ISO27001對風險評鑑僅有提供原則性的要求內容(what)，卻沒有提供實務性的指南內容(How to do)
  - 國際標準ISO27005正好可以提供技術性的支援，為組織的資訊安全風險管理提供實務上的執行指南(Guideline)。
  - ISO27005標準整合了四個管理系統對風險評鑑的要求，因此以ISO27005（Information Technology–Security Techniques – Information Security Risk Management，資訊技術–安全技術–資訊安全風險管理）的實作指引或要求，來作為設計與輔導基礎的實務訓練課程，將是最能滿足各單位需求的訓練方案。

  - ISO/CD 31070 - Risk management - Guidelines on core concepts

- [the process of risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) consists of several steps as follows:
```
Establishing the context
Identification
Assessment
Risk options
Potential risk treatments
Risk management plan
Implementation
Review and evaluation of the plan
```
